Hello everyone,

My name is Andrés Muriel, I was born in Argentina and now I am currently living and working in Germany. I can kind of say that I ended up here because of programming,
but that's more or less the end of the story. A while ago I decided that I wanted to study biotechnology, and I did, I reached the MsC in Biotechnology, which I was/am very happy with!
The thing is, while stuying, and specially during the final year I developed an evergrowing love for bioinformatics and how this tools could solve real life problems. At the
time allthough, I was having a bit of a summer love for molecular biology and industrial microbiology, on which I did my Master's Thesis and worked on for 2 years.

After this two years I realaized I needed a change and that I really wanted to change the fields I was putting my energy on to a one that was more suiting of my interests and passion, 
so I started searching for entry-level jobs on the field of bioinformatics. <irony>To my surprise</irony> there were none to be found in Argentina, so I started searching aborad.
Luckily this search deemed succesfull! And now I am working at a company in Germany where I am learning the basics of programming/bioinformatics and with the guidance of my team leader
(Thank you very much Pablo-sensei) I understood that I wanted/needed to pursue a PhD in the field in order to reach the place I wanted to be. So that's what I am currently working in!
Making my skills suitable to be ellegible por a PhD programm, so what you will mostly see here, it's the different excercises I create myself in order to improve!

I hope I didn't bother you with the text wall, and I also hope that you find the stuff I create usefull. That's my biggest dream at the end of the day, to create usefull things that can make people's live a bit better.

With passion,

Andrés Muriel
